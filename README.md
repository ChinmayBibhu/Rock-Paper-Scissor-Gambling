# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Gambling
Rock-Paper-Scissor Gambling is a fun game that follows the traditional rock paper scissor rules but with a twist of randomness and gambling. The game starts with the home page, and then we choose our elements either rock, paper or scissor by entering our names. Then the game starts.
These three elements start popping up from the screen edges in a random order, random direction and random speed. The don't follow a linear direction but a random path of flow. The weaker element gets converted into stronger element after a collison. All the elements are reflected off the ecreen edges and same elements do not collide with each other. The possibility of winning of any element is close to 33% but Scissor has a slight edge i'll say 45%.
While rock and paper has almost similar possibilities of winning. Currently, the game is following traditional RPS rules but it can be modified with many ideas.

NEXT PLAN:
I plan to extend this game into a gambling aesthetic. I would create a common amount distribution logic, say 5k each player. Out of 5k, each can contribute equal share to a common pool of gamble and the gamble is about the element of their choice. Once everyone put a share in the gamble pool, the round one of game starts. Whichever element remains at the end wins the gamble and so the entire gamble pool is credited to the winner. 
And the gambling continues to next round until other players have money to gamble. If any player get broke, the player with most sum wins.
